# Forza-Random-Race-Selector
## About
This project started becasue my friends and I would have troubles deciding on what race we wanted to do and what type of car 
we wanted to use in Forza Horizon 5. I've been trying to think of a project to get myself back into coding, so this sparked an idea in my brain.

The program's main function will be to randomly select a race amongst the ones presented in the game at its current state (as of 11/28/2021). The program
currently displays the name of the race (as well as the type), the type of car, the performance class, and the type of tune after pressing a button.

I plan on adding preferences to allow you to decide if there's maybe some performance classes that you don't want to do, or maybe you,like my friends and I, 
prefer sprint races over circuit races. Giving the user a choice to pick the manufacturer, country, or year instead of the car type are another featur that I 
plan to implement. I plan on also having the randomizer show a picture of the race highlated within the game to make it easier to navigate to it in game. Very 
late features in my mind include letting you lock in results and maybe randomly selecting a specific car.
